       "       'My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.\\nI have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!\\nI never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.\\n\\niPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.\\n\\nI was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.\\n\\nDisplay quality is truly flagship level and I’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.\\nI would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.\\n\\nYou can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.\\n\\nSpeakers are Great.\\n\\nBattery life is better than my previous devices,\\niOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.\\nNOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.\\n\\nFor the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.\\n\\nBut other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.\\nTruly worth it.',\n",

Doesn’t take good selfies. Literally bad at taking selfies makes you look more ugly.\\n2. Touch is ok ok not as per apple standards but it’s soft.\\n3. Literally hard to transfer data from android to iPhone.\\n4. iCloud storage is only 3 GB after that you need to pay for upgrade, better go for 128GB variant.\\n5. No jack for headphones it is only compatible with Bluetooth headphones, another drawback which I was not aware before buying.\\n6. Most of you would be aware that it doesn’t comes with a charger and you have to buy separately.\\n7. If your hands are wet this phone won’t work. I don’t know if it’s really ip68 waterproof kinda stuff because earlier I had Samsung galaxy S8 and it used to work in water and with wet hands also.\\n\\nOverall, it is highly overpriced as per the features.

Apple products don’t come with replacement, if anything goes bad you have to visit apple care. I visited apple care which is at 70km from my place and they took my phone for service. After three days they provided a new iPhone with replacement letter containing old to new serial no and imei no. So everything ended happily.

I have used it for few months, and i have mixed opinions. I will list the cons and pros:-\\n\\nPros-\\n1) Battery life is awesome. Easily goes a day without charging twice with good amount of social media usages.\\n2) Really smooth UI experience. Feels like 90 fps.\\n3) Display is top notch. Though the screen size could have been bigger.\\n4)Charging is fast as compared to other 20W charging phones.\\n5) Good face unlock feature.\\n6) Great picture quality tho there are some problems i have discussed in cons.\\n6) feels and looks premium\\n\\nCons:-\\n1) Not android friendly. If u are switching from android, u will find it very difficult to use.\\n2) Sells by the name of privacy, but no privacy features like app lock, lock during calls is available.\\n3) Few apps stop working very often. This maybe just with my device as i have doubts that i have recieved a defective device.\\n4) Slo mo videos lags and skip frames on my device. Will get it check by service center.\\n5)No c type support\\n6) Notification management is very poor.\\n7) lack of fingerprint scanner( only android users)\\n8)file system is very bad . They say that it is so to secure the privacy. But it really sucks.\\n\\nSo, if u can go with the cons listed above u can consider it to buy. I will recommend continue to stick to android.

Over the years, it has become more competitive than ever before with a lot of smartphone makers launching their flagship devices every six months.

Then there are features like a smaller notch and a less pronounced rear camera module that might seem insignificant compared to the mentioned features but make a world of difference when it comes to usage. Sure, it’s a tad bit heavier than the iPhone 12 but if you compare it with some of the older iPhone models, like the iPhone 11 or the iPhone XR that I have been using, for what seems like aeons now, you will be grateful for everything that the iPhone 13 offers.',\n",

       "       ['My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.\\nI have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!\\nI never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.\\n\\niPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can?t believe what I?m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.\\n\\nI was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn?t disappointing.\\n\\nDisplay quality is truly flagship level and I?m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.\\nI would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don?t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.\\n\\nYou can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.\\n\\nSpeakers are Great.\\n\\nBattery life is better than my previous devices,\\niOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.\\nNOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.\\n\\nFor the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.\\n\\nBut other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.\\nTruly worth it.'],\n",

Unless you're playing games for hours and hours\\n\\nThat's thanks to a combination of a newer processor, a new screen and a bigger battery. I streamed nine hours of movies, for example, with just over 50% brightness, and still had more than half the battery left.\\n\\nCamera\\nThe regular wide-angle, the zoom and the ultra-wide-angle lenses on the back now allow in more light, which means they're better at taking pictures in the dark.\\n\\nThe HDR feature is also better in situations where your subject might have a lot of light behind them, which can normally make people in a picture look dark ? all the iPhone 13 phones can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone.\\nYou can get really close to an object, like a blueberry or a flower, and capture a lot of detail.\"],\n",

Over the years, it has become more competitive than ever before with a lot of smartphone makers launching their flagship devices every six months. Amid these challenging times Apple, like a bunch of other companies, has maintained a yearly update cycle for its iPhones. In this series, the company, as is customary, announced the iPhone 13 as its successor to last year?s iPhone 12.\\n\\nThe newly launched iPhone 13 delivers minor upgrades over the iPhone 12, which includes a smarter camera, a brighter display, a bigger battery and of course, a more advanced processor to name a few. Then there are features like a smaller notch and a less pronounced rear camera module that might seem insignificant compared to the mentioned features but make a world of difference when it comes to usage. Sure, it?s a tad bit heavier than the iPhone 12 but if you compare it with some of the older iPhone models, like the iPhone 11 or the iPhone XR that I have been using, for what seems like aeons now, you will be grateful for everything that the iPhone 13 offers.'],\n",

Wanted to get an Android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues. 3.
